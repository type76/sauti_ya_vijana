# Youth	Group	1:

# Introduction	to Sauti	ya	Vijana

Goals	for	Group	Leaders
During	Youth	Group	 1	 (YG1),	the	group	leaders will	talk	about	how	the	meetings	will	work,	
emphasize	confidentiality,	and	begin	to	discuss	the	feelings	and	worries	that	are	common	
for	youth	living	with	HIV.	Topics	include:


1. What	the	Sauti	ya	Vijana	program	is	about;
2. What	coming	to	the	program	involves: punctuality	(coming	on	time),	coming	to	
work	hard	(not	under	the	influence	of	alcohol	or	drugs),	confidentiality	(what	
happens	in	group	stays	in	group) and	logistics	(when,	how	long,	travel	money);
3. How	the	program	can help	youth	cope	with	worries and	difficulties	that	come	from
living	with	HIV;
4. How	the stress	is	very	common;
5.How	living	with	HIV	comes	with	difficulties--- taking	medicine,	feeling	ill,	talking	
with	others;	and	worries	and	stress	reactions	that	many	youth share;	and
6. How	group	members	can help	each	other	by	sharing	and	providing	support.

assigned 6.	Fun	time


_We	are	so	glad	you	are	all	able	to	be	here.	Today	we	are	going	to	talk	about	how	the	program	
works.		We	want	to	stress	the	importance	of	arriving	on	time,	coming	prepared	and	ready	to	
learn,	being	engaged	in	the	sessions,	and respecting	confidentiality	and	safety	with	both	your	
youth	group	and with the	caregivers.	_


_We	will	also	have	a	discussion	about	the	kinds	of	worries	that	youth	with	HIV/AIDS have	told	
us	about—you	may	share some	of	your	own worries	in	the	group.	You	can	join	in	the	
conversation	if	you	like	or	just	listen._

2. Getting	to	know	each other (10 minutes)		

_We	will	start	by	getting	to	know	each	other._

GROUP	ACTIVITY **-** Engage	with	group	members	as	they	join	with	one	another.	The	group	
makes	a	circle	standing	with	the	group	leaders	for	these	activities.

```
o Start	with	something	fun:	With	the	group	in	a	circle,	throw	a	ball	to	each	other	
around	the	circle.	As	each	person	catches	the	ball	he/she	shouts	their	own	first	
name.	Keep	going	until	names	have	been	shouted at	least	twice.
o Then,	the	youth	and	group	leaders say	the	name	of	another	person and	throw	
the	ball	to	him/her.
o The	group	can	also play	a	game	throwing	the	ball	with	questions	you	and	the	
youth	both	answer.	Questions	may	be	like	“what	is	your	favorite	music	or	sport?”
```
3. Introduction	to	group	activities (20 minutes).	Group	leaders	describe	how	the	group	
    meetings	will	work	every	week.
- Provide	handout	to	the	youth	(YG	Handout	1) for	dates,	times	of	groups,	and	names	
and	phone	numbers	of	the	group	leaders.
- Discuss	about	how	the	groups	will	work.
o 1	home	visit	for	youth	and	caregiver	before	the	meetings	start	(or	by	telephone)
o 8	 group	meetings	youth	only
o 2	 meetings	jointly	with	caregiver or	other	supportive	adult
o 2	individual	meetings	between	a	group	leader	and	youth
o Final	celebration
- Discuss	travel	reimbursement and	consequences	for	being	late.
o An	example	of	support	for	punctuality	may	be	giving	star	stickers in	order	to	
earn	a	small	prize	at	the	final	party	for	those	who	consistently	arrived	on	time.


```
The	best	incentive	is	reinforcing	the	group	norm	for	being	on	time	for	each	
meeting.
```
- Emphasize	expectations	for	attendance.
    o Note	that	these	group	meetings build on	each	other.		Emphasize	that	missing	
       even	one	session	can	make	it	difficult	to	understand	the	next	meetings.		
    o Missing	more	than	one	session	may	mean	the	youth	cannot	continue	in	their	
       assigned	group. The	youth	are	asked	to	discuss	absences	with	the	group	
       leaders	to	plan	for	making	up	that	part	of	the	program	or	being	able	to	join	a	
       future	group,	if	possible.
    o Be	clear	with	the	youth	that	it	is	to	their	benefit	to	come	prepared	to	learn,	to	
       share	with	others,	and	to	have	some	fun	together.
- Show	the	general	group	schedule	on	handout	YG	Handout	1.
    1) Tea	and	social	gathering
    2) Brief	review of	what	happened	in	the	previous	meeting	(if	applicable)
    3) Review	homework	assigned	from	last	group	(if	applicable)
    4) New	topic:	discussion	and	practice
    5) Assign	new	homework
    6) Fun	time – games	and	play
- Emphasize	expectations	for	youth	and	caregiver/other	adult	support	regarding	
confidentiality.

**_There	are serious	issues	about	confidentiality	to	discuss_** _!	_

```
o Describe	the	importance	of	confidentiality	in	the	group: What	is	said	in	the	
group	stays	in	the	group.	
o Discuss	that	what	the	youth	talk	about	in	the	group	is	confidential.		They	can	
discuss, in	general, their	personal	experiences with	a	caregiver	or	friend	but	
never talk	with	others	about someone	else	who	is	in the	group.	
o The	youth	cannot	tell	anyone	(including	their caregiver or	other	support	
adults)	what	other	youth	have	talked	about	in	the	group.	To	do	so would	
violate	their promise	of	confidentiality.
```
```
This	picture	reminds	us	about	confidentiality.
```
```
ü To	have	big	ears	(listening)	and	a	little	mouth
ü What	is	said	in	group	stays	in	group
```

```
o The	group	leaders	will	only discuss	the	youth	with	their	caregiver	if	there	is	a	
fear	about	safety,	such	as	the	youth	may	harm	someone	or	hurt	themselves.
```
_Do	we	all	agree	to	the	promise	of	confidentiality?	_

- Please	give	the	youth	and	caregivers/other	support	person	the	confidentiality	
    agreement	and	have	them	review	and	sign	(attached).

At	this	point	the	caregiver	group	will	go	to	a	separate	room, and	the	youth	will	continue	in	
their	usual	room	(see	script	at	the	end	of	Youth	Group	1	for	caregiver only dialogue.)


4. New	topic: Common	mental	health	symptoms	(stress	and	worries)
for	youth	living	with	HIV/AIDS ( 2 5	minutes)

_Let	us	talk	about:	What	is	health?	What	is good	physical	health? (Examples	may	include:		not	
having	a	fever,	feeling	good	to	run	and	play	football	and	to	do	daily	chores	like	fetching	water,	
sweeping the floor)._

_What	is	good	mental	health (such	as,	being	able	to	handle	worries	and	difficulties	that	come	
in	everyone’s	life)?_

- Summarize	what	other	youth	report	about some	of	the	difficulties	and	worries	they	
    face	living	with	HIV/AIDS (Use	YG	Handout	2).

_Here are	some	worries	we	have	learned	from	other	youth	living	with	HIV.		I	am	going	to	name	
some	of	these	as	they are	listed	on	your	Youth	Group	Handout	2.	Can	anyone	think	of	worries	
that	other	youth	may	have?		Please	tell	us,	and	we	will	add	to	the	list.	_

```
o Use	handout	with	lists	split	down	middle	as	shown	below.	
o Review	the	list	of	worries	on	YG	Handout	2.		Ask	youth	to	think	about	additional	
worries	other	people	may	have	(not	necessarily	their	own	worries).
o Add	to	list	of	worries	using	YG	Handout	2	as	volunteered	by	the	group	members	
in	the	group	activity	described	below.
```
Handout	for	Stress,	Worries,	and	Coping (YG	Handout	2).		Participants	can	take	the	handout
home	or	leave	it	with	group	leaders	for	next	week.

YG	Handout	2.
Stress	and	worries Things	that	can	help	youth	cope
Worry	about	remembering	to	take	
medicine
Worry	I	might	die
Worry	about	others	knowing	I	have	HIV


GROUP	ACTIVITY- Group	members	get	into	groups	of	2-3	and	fill	out	some	of	the	things	
youth	(in	general)	worry	about	when	living	with	HIV.		Ask	the	group	to	just	make	a	list	on	
the	left side	of	the	handout.	Ask	one	group	to	report	what	they	wrote,	then	other	groups	
can	add	any	worries	they	wrote	down	that	were	not	included	on	others’	lists.		Group	
leaders	list	these	worries	on	a	whiteboard/flip	chart.

- Be	sure	to	ask	the	group	members	to make	a	list	of	what	people	might	worry	about	in	
    the	situation	of	HIV/AIDS.	This	is	not	a	time	to	ask	group	members	for	a	personal	
    response--- this	is	phrased	as	“ _What	do	you	think	other	youth	might	worry	about.”_

_Your	group leaders	believe	that	naming worries	is	the	first	step to	thinking	about	ways	to	
cope and	learning	to	do some things to	feel	better and	be less	worried._

- Normalize	and	validate	the	worries	listed.	The	goal	is	to	help	the	youth	realize	they	are	
    not	the	only	ones	with	these	worries;	they	are	not	alone	with	these	stresses.		Make	
    validating	statements	to	let	the	youth	know	that	how	they	feel	makes	sense	and	is	
    common	(they	are	not	crazy,	and	they	are	not	stupid).

_We	think	you	already	know	that	many	of	these	worries	are	common.	They	are	“normal”	for	
youth	who	are	thinking	about	their	illness	or	other	problems.	Youth	with	HIV infection want	
to	just	be	like	everyone	else,	to	go	to	school,	to	have	friends,	and	to	experience	all	the	good	
things	about	growing	up	and	becoming	an	adult.	_

_Naming	these	worries	and	finding	ways	to	feel	better	are	just	a	few	of	the	ways	that	this	
program	can	help	you.		We	will	continue	1)	naming	worries	and 2)	thinking	about	ways	to	
cope.		Next	week	we	will	also	practice	some	ways	of	calming	the	mind	and	the	body. Later	we	
will	practice	talking	with	friends	and	others	you	trust.	This	means	we	will	plan	how	to	
continue	living	positively	with	HIV/AIDS._

- For the	other	side	of	YG	Handout	

_We	are also	 going to	think about	things	in	life	that	help	us	cope	and be	less	stressed about	
these	worries.	We	will	talk	about	some	of	the	things	people	do	to	feel	better	in	the	next	
meeting, and we	will	keep	talking	about	ways	we	have	to	calm	our	minds	and	bodies	when	
stress	and	worries	do	happen._

- Instill	hope that	this	program	can	help

_You	may	be	wondering	how	a	group	like	this	can	help.	We	know	from	other	groups	like	yours,	
here,	in	other	parts	of	Africa,	and	in	other	parts of	the	world	like	United	States	and	Europe,	_


_that	there	are	activities	that	really	help	with	the	stresses	of	an	illness	like	HIV/AIDS.	This	is	
called	gaining	more	mental	health—no	person	is	completely	without	mental	health	
difficulties	and	worries,	but	there	are	ways	to	live positively	with	these	worries	and	difficulties
and	to	have	a	good	life._

_Important	things	that	will	happen	on	these	Saturday	group	meetings	will	include:_
o _More	education	about	HIV;_
o _Talking	about	thoughts,	feelings,	and	behaviors	that	come	with	living	with	a	
chronic	illness	like	HIV/AIDS;_
o _Discussing	about	how	to	cope	when	stress	comes;_
o _Telling	group	leaders	(and	maybe	others)	about	some	hard	memories	about	
learning	about	and	living	with	HIV;_
o _Figuring	out	who	your	best	support	people	are;	_
o _Discussing	stigma and disclosure	about	your	status	to	others; and_
o _Naming	your	values	for	living positively.	_

5. Homework	assigned (10	minutes).	The	group	leaders	ask	group
members	to	practice	before	the	next	group	meeting	naming	their	stresses	and	worries	and,	
if	possible,	naming	some	ways	they	use	to	cope	with	worries.	

_Please	think	about	and	consider	writing	on	YG	Handout	2	the	stresses	and	worries	that	happen	
over	this	week.		If	you	did	something	to	help	reduce	that	stress	or	worry,	please	write	it	in	the	
second	column.		_

- Emphasize	that	to	learn	anything	new	and	to	learn	to	do	it	well,	we	all	have to	practice
    the	new	skill	over	and	over.	The	more	we	practice,	the	better	we	are	at	the	skill.	Use	an	
    example	like	learning	to	sew,	ride	a	bike,	or	carve	wood.

_The	more	you	practice	these	skills, the	easier	it	will	be	to	use	them	when	you	are	feeling	
stressed.		This	week,	your	practice	will	be	to	pay	attention	to	naming	the	stress	and	worries	
that	come	up	in	your	everyday	life,	things	about	which	you	get	sad	or	anxious.	Once	you	name	_


_the	worry,	try	to	remember	if	you	were	able	to	do	anything	to	feel	better	at	that	time.	This	is	
your	homework.		You	may	even	feel	comfortable	to	tell	the	group	about	these	at	the	next	
meeting;	talking	in	the	group	meetings	is	always	your	choice._

6. Fun	time	(10	minutes).		Reunion	with	caregiver	for	joining	a	fun	activity	to	
    be determined	by	group	leaders.
